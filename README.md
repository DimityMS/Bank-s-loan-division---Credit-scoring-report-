# Project: To prepare a report for a bank’s loan division

To meet bank's requirements I need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan.

Task clarification: To find a defualt rate benchmark and compare it to customer’s marital status and number of children.

Steps:

1. Getting data ready for analysis (preprocess missing values, data types, duplicates and categorization).

2. To find the share of defaulted costumers on a loan.

3. To compre costumers with and without children with a default rate.

4. To compare customers marital status with a default rate.
